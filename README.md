## 📚 My Projects

1. [The Alluring experience](https://louuu03.github.io/TheAlluringExperience/)

    Modern love needs modern solution.😤 I came up with this idea: here are couple counsel, wedding planning, surprise planning, and anything you can imagine. We even have services for people who are busy so that the gifts would be sent on the anniversary or any special days you want!!

2. [Guess Whaat!](https://guesswhaat.netlify.app/)🎶

    This is a fun game which gets your top 20 songs from spotify and hides a sentence from the lyrics of a random song in your top 20. You need to type in the right answer to get a point. And I bet you can't get 5 out of 5.😜

3. [Wordle Copie](https://wordlecopie.netlify.app/)

    Me and my friends fell for wordle so hard that I decide to make a copy, too. It is a simple clone which I could replace the answer to some weird word.😈
